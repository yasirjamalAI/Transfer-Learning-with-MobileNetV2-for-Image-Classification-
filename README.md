# Flower Classification using MobileNetV2 ðŸŒ¸  

This project applies transfer learning using MobileNetV2 to classify flower images into five categories: Daisy, Rose, Sunflower, Tulip, and Dandelion. The dataset is preprocessed with data augmentation, and the model is fine-tuned for improved accuracy. Performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Then trained model is saved.
